## Print build identification information (from `build.prop`)

`build.prop` is expected to be at the root of every symbols `.tar.gz`.

The following command will print the contents of this file on STDOUT:

    $ sudo docker run --rm symbols build-properties

a different tag can be specified:

    $ sudo docker run --rm symbols:'some other tag' build-properties
